      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet that
      supports life. It has a unique combination of land, water, and atmosphere,
      creating a perfect environment for diverse plants, animals, and humans.
      About 71% of Earth>’s surface is covered by oceans, which regulate the
      climate and provide habitats for marine life. The atmosphere protects
      living organisms by filtering harmful solar rays and maintaining
      temperature balance. Earth also has a magnetic field that shields it from
      cosmic radiation. Its rich biodiversity and natural resources make it a
      remarkable and fragile home for all species.

        <b>🌐 Earth Is the Only Known Planet With Life:</b>
        <p>
          Earth is the only planet in the universe (so far) known to support
          life, thanks to its perfect distance from the Sun, water availability,
          and breathable atmosphere.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>🌊 70% of Earth Is Covered by Water: </b>
        <p>
          About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by oceans, lakes, and rivers.
          However, only around 3% of that is freshwater!
        </p>

        <b>🌍 Earth Has a Powerful Magnetic Field:</b>
        <p>
          Earth’s magnetic field protects us from harmful solar winds and cosmic
          radiation. It’s generated by the motion of molten iron in the planet’s
          outer core.

          <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/">Moon</a>:
        </b>
        <p>
          The Moon stabilizes Earth’s tilt and causes ocean tides. It's the
          fifth largest moon in the solar system.

        <b>🌀 Earth Spins at 1,670 km/h (1,038 mph):</b>
        <p>
          Earth rotates once every 24 hours, creating day and night. Despite
          spinning so fast, we don’t feel it due to gravity and the atmosphere
          moving with us.
